# The Note

Odysseas makes great videos on productivity. I was introduced to his channel through the Obsidian guide he made, where he details how to use this software.

In the below video, Odysseas details his use-case for mini-essays. For him, they essentially act as a tool for learning. Think of it like a "detailed note": mini-essays are typically 100-300 words long and only cover one specific topic. They should only take a few minutes each to write, and should discourage rambling.

The goal when writing them is to imagine that you are educating an audience on the subject you are writing about. Odysseas claims that "teaching is learning", an argument I can give credence through my own personal experiences. Odysseas mentions that this idea of mini-essays stems from the [[Feynman Technique]], a method of learning that can potentially provide a deep understanding of material.

Odysseas is not shy about the fact that mini-essays take time and effort, but he argues that the rewards mini-essays can offer make those commitments worth it. Not only does the writer gain a deeper under standing of the material they are learning, but the writer is also given wider flexibility to explore fields they might be interested in. Because of the short but singular nature of mini-essays, branching into different fields of knowledge is considerably easier, especially with the retention that mini-essays offer.
