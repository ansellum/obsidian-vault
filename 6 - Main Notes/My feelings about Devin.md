# The Note

Where do I even begin? Let's start with just the last weekend.

To be honest, the hangout and our relationship still feels 'off' in a way; I don't feel like Devin is someone I can talk to naturally yet, and I know he hates that. A lot of time is spent in silence because I don't really know what to talk about, which is something to worry about if we consider a future relationship. That's primarily why I *want* to have a platonic friendship first, because if not, we're just in a relationship for the love but not because we're *in* love. 

I can tell he's good for me. His presence in my life is largely responsible for why I haven't completely spiraled into a drug-addict mess. I've spent the last two months smoking and playing video games and not doing much else to be honest, and it feels both great and terrible. I know I have shit to do; I will run out of money eventually. But job-hunting is so demotivating, that it makes it hard to really give a shit.

With Devin in my life for the past few weeks however, I feel much more invigorated to get *something* going. Devin's life is so busy and he does so much, not just for himself but primarily for those around him. He does so much for *me*. Last weekend was the party, and that was a huge undertaking (as it always is). It's not even his intentions, or even his actions TBH. It's the fact that his life has *drive*, that his life is *constantly moving*. When I'm a part of it, like I have been the last two weeks, my life also starts to move. I became excited to do the patent interview, I am deciding to write instead of smoke tonight, I am undertaking more projects instead of smoking. I actually started job applications again. Devin has unintentionally started turning my life, by simple merit of how his life is always turning.

With all that being said, is Devin even the person for me? Yes, he is a net benefit to my life. Yes, he understands me like no one else. Yes, he loves me unconditionally and more than anyone else probably will. But I'm just not *feeling it* like that. I am highly appreciative of him, both of his presence and of his impact on my life. He's perfect for me in so many ways, but he doesn't provide what I specifically am looking for in a partner. I want a partner who challenges my views and comfortabilities, someone who shows *me* new things. Someone who takes an interest in how deeply I explore subjects, and in turn, tries to outdo me or teach me things in the same way I like teaching others things. Someone who does things that forces me to step outside my comfort zone, something that Devin doesn't provide. 

Am I asking too much? Devin does so much for me, and I have no reason *not* to love him. Perhaps a part of me wants us both to grow much more before considering something serious. I don't feel like I'm in a part of my life to settle; I'm in the part of my life that wants to explore and experiment. Clinging to Devin, while it feels good in the moment, is a fleeting comfort; I still feel jaded and I still feel entrapped. I don't know what to feel sometimes; sometimes he's just not attractive to me, and at other times he's the best thing for me. I don't know yet.

If anything is clear, it's that I should enforce **platonic friendship** more. We're now 3 for 3 on having sex whenever we meet in-person and in private. Hugs are fine, but no hand-holding and no kissing. Shucks.
