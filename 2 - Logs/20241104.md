### Log Entry
Woke up late, though my back is not as pained as it was yesterday. I'm deciding not to go to the King Gizzard concert, despite having tickets. I want to work on Obsidian and I don't really feel like making my evening full of pain in terms of standing and sitting and moving. And while I like King Gizzard I don't care enough to *really* go? IDK.

I got out off bed at around 2PM and made coffee and started working on obsidian. I also texted Devin bc I miss him. I played the ocarina for a good half hour although with the amount of time I'm putting in, I wonder if I should pick up the guitar again.
