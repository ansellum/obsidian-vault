# The Note

So what is the Feynman Technique? Odysseas details it a bit in his [[Mini-essays]] video, but essentially, the Feynman Technique is a method of learning that prioritizes retention and deep understanding.

The Feynman Technique is comprised of four sequential parts:

1. **Select a topic** - Not only choosing what to learn about, but choosing *what* to delve into. What things do you want to learn *about* a subject?

2. **Teach it** - Do you have a deep enough understanding to be able to summarize? Do you understand the topic enough to be able to teach it to a child?

3. **Review and Refine** - Write down your understanding. Avoid jargon and rambling. Prioritize being brief yet informative. If something is confusing, you need to refine it.

4. **Organize** - Organize the work you have done into your knowledge database (obsidian!)
