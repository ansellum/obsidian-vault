# The Note

Just got back from VGO rehearsal. It was actually really nice; the rain was coming down while driving back and though it made the ride somewhat stressful, it was a great vibe. You know I always love when it rains.

Regardless, VGO rehearsal went pretty well! We played both Grim Fandango and Doggone Dogfight, which had me dancing all over haha. I also finally got my part from Valerie for Losing Father's Sword, and its fun! It's not too hard which is nice because I honestly need to work on arranging and jobs, but its nice to actually have a piece.

The other nice thing about rehearsal was that I finally got to show off :)))) at the end of rehearsal, I tried playing Rude Buster but failed (???), so I decided fuck it and played Revolutionary Etude and Fantasie Impromptu. To my surprise, people actually came over to watch (namely Elijah and Radish) which was really cool! Made me nervous of course, which made me play far faster than I can comfortably play, but I still put forth a good performance and received praise from the aforementioned. Sean also complimented me but in a way that told me to GTFO lol.

The other thing that happened today was waking up in Devin's arms. We spent the night together after Devin came over yesterday for Halloween. Funnily enough, we were supposed to get trick-or-treaters, but none came by after he arrived. I wish I gave those kids more candy TBH; I would've if I knew I would only get seven kids. Damn.

Putting that aside though, the hangout was middling. We watched Hocus Pocus, and I was able to get him to play Echoes of Wisdom. I also smoked around him for the first time. Afterwards, he got sleepy so we fooled around a bit in bed and fell asleep. Today was probably my favorite part of our hangout; I got to work on my own projects (Klipper UART and Obsidian) while he worked on his laptop in my bedroom. Afterwards, he played more Zelda and then left for VGO. My feelings for today and about Devin are somewhat complicated, so I'll make it a new note below.
