# The Note

Today was a good day. I mainly toyed with my 3D printer since I finally got it working. I learned a lot of Obsidian today, finally fleshing out the structure and usage. I am torn on making a reflections folder, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the graph doesn't it? 

While I was making coffee, my ocarina came in too! I practiced it for over an hour; something I really need to work on is breath control.

I called Devin for a good few hours tonight. He finished portal 2, we played  Getting Over It, and we watched a Technology Connections video. I hope I'm not jinxing it, but I'm starting to like him a bit.
