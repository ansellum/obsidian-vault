# The Note

Devin was explaining in his stories how *I* came to be in his life, from his perspective. He drew a lot of parallels between me and Aaron, essentially what we both meant to him individually in his life.

Aaron, as Devin described, was like a broken artist. I am gathering that Devin has a type haha. I don't know if Aaron had great aspirations like I do, but he was a twisted soul all the same. He had mental issues, a big reason Devin does not feel scared away by any of my problems. One in particular that I remember is how Aaron had an alter-ego named Kyle who would take over his left hand and force him to do crazy things. I love how tolerant Devin is, even if that personally would scare me quite a bit.

Devin was there for Aaron when he was heartbroken over his ex, and Devin spent a lot of his time the last few years regretting not asking him out then. In my opinion, it's shitty of Aaron to say Devin only had a chance as a rebound, but Devin has his own closure about the whole ordeal that I'd rather not tinker with or prod about.

Basically, my takeaway from this is that I shouldn't get so spiraled and wrapped up in my own world. Yes, I'm the worst person in the world in my world. But Devin has never seen me that way. He understands that I'm trying to be a good person, that I try to help people because I feel like I can, not because of some chivalrous white-knight like Aaron did. I want to hear more about him, if it doesn't pain Devin. I like hearing about Devin's life.
