# The Note

I'm starting to get a hang of this note-taking business. I am using the Obsidian format from Odysseas' video, which explains why Obsidian has worked best for him. Our use-cases are fairly different; he primarily uses Obsidian as a learning companion, while I plan to use Obsidian more as a jotting and journal tool.

So far, I'm actually really liking it! The structure makes sense, the linking is cool, and best of all, its all local AND open-source. Perhaps I will aim to use Obsidian like Odysseas, since I do take interest in knowledge and connections, and fleshing out my own mind. Becoming a hobby scholar sounds fun to me because I like the idea of being educated in many areas, and being able to converse in many subjects. 

#### Goals
